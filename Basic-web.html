    <h3>What Is This Theme About</h3>
    <p id="WITTA">
        In this theme, I was introduced to the basic terminology within user interface design, digital communication, user testing, and responsive web design. <br>I learned html and css coding as well as basic image processing (Photoshop) and vector drawing (Illustrator). <br>During this theme, I cover edbasic web design from research and ideation to design and development for the web.

    <h3>Responsive Website</h3>
    <p>
        In this project we needed to make our first site, about a certain style, into a responsive site, using grids.
        <br>while working on the project, I had to recreate my website because i couldn't add the grids properly without ruining the layout of the site.
