    <p class="UXpg">
        Growing up with an Israeli dad and a Danish mom, I grew up with kind of a mixed culture.<br>
        After finishing my millitary service in Israel, i decided to move to Denmark without any plans, except for some formal matters. I learned the Danish language for about a year while working as a waitress.<br>
        After a while i decided to look into studying and found the MMD program at KEA.<br>
        My entire life I lived with animals and became vegetarian at age 11 and vegan at age 17. One of my goals in life is to do something to help animals and improve animal rights. I hope that with the skills i learn at the MMD program, I would be able to get closer to achiving that goal.
